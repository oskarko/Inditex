# Inditex
Technical test for the Inditex Group (ZARA)

# Documentation:
- I have selected VIP pattern (a.k.a. "Clean Swift")
- Calling to the API has been made without any third library. In my opinion it is not necessary nowadays at all.
- Just for lack of time, I did NOT add any other extra feature: SearchBar, localized strings...

# How to test
- Clone the project
- Run the project 🥳
